Many social media applications enable users to send images. But security of images is a major concern. This is the motivation of our project(My undergrad project - 2014)

This is an Android application that provides security for Images. When image is selected from the gallery, it is encrypted at the sender's side. The receiver can decrypt the image while using this app. So, its travel in the network is now secured.
